## **Project Overview**
The premise of our project was to solve a challenge that several people are experiencing working in a remote environment. We hoped to offer a solution to finding optimal meeting times across several schedules for multiple potential dates. We explored several different components of programming to offer an application that can handle the complexity of storing data while providing an attractive user interface. Our application is designed to find the optimal time for recurring meetings for teams consisting of five or less members. Once all of the members have inputted their availability for a week, the optimal time for the group to meet will be outputted on the website’s display. 

## **Application Installment**
Before you can use our application, you must download and install all the components required. First, you have to have **Python** installed (at least the latest version as of 11/2020) on your computer. Then, **install flask** through the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac OS). 

**Install our code** from the Project Github. Open the directory on your Command Prompt/Terminal and type the following in: 

**set FLASK_APP=app.py** 

**set FLASK_ENV=development** 

**flask run**

Then you’re prepared to start running our code!

## **User Guide**

### **For the Host**

Begin by ensuring that you have properly installed and downloaded our code and the other components required for the application. Once our website is launched, look for the Create an Event CTA. You will then be prompted to enter an event name, meeting duration and enter the names of the participants. Be cautious when entering this information as it may not be modified at a later point and any typos could result in an error. After submitting, you can then enter your availability which will expedite the process and allow your participants to instantly see optimal meeting times based on your availability. Then, you should then provide your users with the link to the homepage and the event name so that they can enter their availability. 

After your team has filled out their availability, you will be able to view the optimal meeting time on the right side of the event’s homepage. 

### **For the Participants**

After you have been provided with the event name, launch the homepage for the application. You should find on the left side of the screen there is a section dedicated to pre-existing meetings. Enter the event name you received from the host and your first name. Then, select the corresponding time boxes with your availability for the week. After you submit, you will be able to see the optimal meeting time, on the right column, based on the participants that have already entered their schedule. 

## **Conclusion**

Through this application, we are able to relieve the stress of finding optimal meeting times for people during these challenging times. Our application provides an easy quick solution that is able to efficiently read multiple schedules and provide the perfect time for you and your team to meet. This project was also an amazing learning opportunity for the three students involved to exercise their coding skills and collaborate to overcome challenges. This project is a collective product of the knowledge they have gained related to the topic of Web Design, Information Technology and User Experiences. We hope that it provides a simpler, more efficient way for you and your teams to meet.
